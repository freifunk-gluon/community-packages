# gluon-mesh-vpn-wireguard-vxlan

You can use this package for connecting with wireguard to the Freifunk Munich network.

You should use something like the following in the site.conf:

	
```
 mesh_vpn = {
	mtu = 1400,
	wireguard = {
		enabled = '1',
		iface = 'mesh-vpn',
		limit = '1', -- actually unused
		broker = 'broker.ffmuc.net/api/v1/wg/key/exchange',
		peers = {
				{
					publickey ='N9uF5Gg1B5AqWrE9IuvDgzmQePhqhb8Em/HrRpAdnlY=',
					endpoint ='ffkwsn01.freifunk-koenigswinter.de:30020',
					link_address = 'fe80::f000:22ff:fe12:01',
				},
				{
					publickey ='liatbdT62FbPiDPHKBqXVzrEo6hc5oO5tmEKDMhMTlU=',
					endpoint ='ffkwsn02.freifunk-koenigswinter.de:30020',
					link_address = 'fe80::f000:22ff:fe12:02',
				},
				{
					publickey ='xakSGG39D1v90j3Z9eVWzojh6nDbnsVUc/RByVdcKB0=',
					endpoint ='ffkwsn03.freifunk-koenigswinter.de:30020',
					link_address = 'fe80::f000:22ff:fe12:07',
				},

			},
	},
	
```


And you should include the package in the site.mk of course!
